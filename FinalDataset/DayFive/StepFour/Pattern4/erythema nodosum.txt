Erythema nodosum is a type of skin inflammation that is located in a certain portion of the fatty layer of skin.
Erythema nodosum (also called EN) results in reddish, painful, tender lumps most commonly located in the front of the legs.
The tender lumps, or nodules, of erythema nodosum range in size from one to five centimeters. Inflammation in the fatty layer of skin causes the nodular swelling.
Erythema nodosum can be self-limited and resolve on its own in three to six weeks. Upon resolution, it may leave only a temporary bruised appearance or leave a chronic indentation in the skin where the fatty layer was injured.
