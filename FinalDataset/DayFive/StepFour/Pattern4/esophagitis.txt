Esophagitis can be caused by infection, irritation of the esophagus, or inflammation of the lining of the esophagus.
There are several types of esophagitis, for example:Reflux esophagitisInfectious esophagitisBarrett's esophagusEosinophilic esophagitisBehçet's syndrome (also called Behçet's disease)Graft-versus-host diseaseCancer esophagitis
Reflux esophagitis
Infectious esophagitis
Barrett's esophagus
Eosinophilic esophagitis
Behçet's syndrome (also called Behçet's disease)
Graft-versus-host disease
Cancer esophagitis
Tests to help diagnose esophagitis include esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), esophageal manometry, and an upper GI series or barium swallow.
Treatment for esophagitis depends on its cause. It may be treated with:.Diet and lifestyle changesMedicationsEndoscopyStretching (dilatation) the esophagusSurgery

Diet can often help reduce symptoms of esophagitis. The GERD diet is aimed at reducing acid reflux, the main cause of esophagitis.
Complications of esophagitis include bleeding, ulcers, chronic scarring, difficult or painful swallowing, and malnutrition. Barrett's esophagus is a complication that increases the risk of esophageal cancer.
A gastroenterologist, a specialist in conditions of the gastrointestinal tract, treats esophagitis.
The prognosis for esophagitis depends on the underlying cause. Esophagitis caused by infection or inflammation is generally treatable and most people can recover fully. Esophagitis caused by reflux can recur frequently. Many people with GERD develop Barrett's esophagus, which increases the risk for cancer. The outlook for patients with eosinophilic esophagitis is favorable. It is a chronic, relapsing condition, but not usually life threatening. Achalasia is progressive, but treatable.
