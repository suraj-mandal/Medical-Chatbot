Laryngitis is an inflammation of the voice cords in the voice box (larynx).
Causes of laryngitis include upper respiratory infection or the common cold; overuse of the vocal cords by talking, singing, or shouting; gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) causing reflux laryngitis; smoking; exposure to secondhand smoke; or exposure to polluted air.
Laryngitis is contagious if it is caused by an infection.
The most common signs and symptoms of laryngitis are hoarseness, loss of voice, and throat pain.
Additional signs and symptoms of laryngitis in adults may include dry, sore throat, pain with swallowing, and a feeling of fullness in the throat or neck. If the laryngitis is caused by an infection, the affected person also may have symptoms of fever, swollen lymph nodes (swollen glands).
Additional signs and symptoms of laryngitis in infants or children are associated with croup and include a hoarse barky cough and fever.
Laryngitis is considered chronic when signs and symptoms of last longer than three weeks.
Chronic laryngitis may be caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease, smoking, constant exposure to secondhand smoke, air pollution, or alcohol use.
Chronic inflammation due to laryngitis may cause the formation of nodules or polyps on the vocal cords.
Treatment of laryngitis is usually symptomatic with voice rest, humidified air, and natural and home remedies for symptom relief.
If signs and symptoms of laryngitis persist for more than three weeks or continue to recur, make an appointment with a doctor.
Complications of laryngitis from GERD include pneumonia, chronic bronchitis, and vocal cord paralysis.
