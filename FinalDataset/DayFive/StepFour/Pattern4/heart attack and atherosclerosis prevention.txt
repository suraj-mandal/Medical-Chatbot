A heart attack happens when the flow of blood that brings oxygen to the heart 
muscle is significantly reduced or cut off completely. This is often a result of 
atherosclerosis, a process whereby the arteries narrow due to a buildup of 
plaque (fat, cholesterol, and other substances). Sometimes these plaques can 
break off, and blood clots can form around them. The clots in the coronary 
arteries then block blood flow to the heart, starving it of oxygen and nutrients 
(ischemia), causing damage or death to heart muscle. This damage to the heart 
muscle is a heart attack. Heart attack is medically termed myocardial 
infarction (MI).
