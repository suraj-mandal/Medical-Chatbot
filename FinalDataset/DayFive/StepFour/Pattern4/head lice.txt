Head lice are parasites that are found on human heads. The word lice is plural for louse.
Head lice spread from person to person by head-to-head contact through direct contact with the hair of an infested person. Although less common, head lice can spread by personal contact or the sharing of combs, brushes, caps, and other clothing.
Head lice are a common problem with preschool and elementary school-aged children.
Head lice cause a tickling feeling of something moving in the hair, itching, and sores on the head.
The affected individual, family members also infected, and the home all should be treated.
Remember: one head louse + one head louse = two head lice = the beginning of a head-lice infection.
Very young children should be evaluated by a health care professional before beginning medications.
