Hives (medically known as urticaria) are red, itchy, raised welts on the skin that appear in varying shapes and sizes; each one characteristically lasts no longer than six to 12 hours.
Although hives are very common, their cause is often elusive.
Hives can change size rapidly and move around, disappearing in one place and reappearing in other places, often in a matter of hours.
Ordinary hives flare up suddenly.
Occasionally hives are produced by direct physical stimulation by environmental forces like heat, cold, and sunlight.
Treatment of hives is directed at symptom relief until the condition goes away on its own.
Antihistamines are the most common treatment for hives.
Hives typically are not associated with long-term or serious complications.
