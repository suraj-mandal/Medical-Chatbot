Cirrhosis is a complication of liver disease that involves loss of liver cells and irreversible scarring of the liver.
Alcohol and viral hepatitis B and C are common causes of cirrhosis, although there are many other causes.
Cirrhosis can cause weakness, loss of appetite, easy bruising, yellowing of the skin (jaundice), itching, and fatigue.
Diagnosis of cirrhosis can be suggested by history, physical examination and blood tests, and can be confirmed by liver biopsy.
Complications of cirrhosis include:Swelling of the abdomen (ascites) and/or in the hip, thigh, leg, ankle, and footSpontaneous bacterial peritonitisBleeding from varicesHepatic encephalopathyHepatorenal syndromeHepatopulmonary syndromeHypersplenismLiver cancer
Swelling of the abdomen (ascites) and/or in the hip, thigh, leg, ankle, and foot
Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis
Bleeding from varices
Hepatic encephalopathy
Hepatorenal syndrome
Hepatopulmonary syndrome
Hypersplenism
Liver cancer
Treatment of cirrhosis is designed to prevent further damage to the liver, treat complications of cirrhosis, and preventing or detecting liver cancer early.
Transplantation of the liver is an important option for treating patients with advanced cirrhosis.
There is no cure for cirrhosis of the liver, and for some people the prognosis is poor. The life expectancy for advanced cirrhosis is 6 months to 2 years depending on complications of cirrhosis, and if no donor is available for liver transplantation The life expectancy for people with cirrhosis and acholic hepatitis can be as high as 50%.
The life expectancy is more that 12 years for a person with cirrhosis and no major complications.
