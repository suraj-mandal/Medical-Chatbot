Anemia is a medical condition in which the red blood cell count or hemoglobin is less than normal.
For men, anemia is typically defined as hemoglobin level of less than 13.5 gram/100 ml and in women as hemoglobin of less than 12.0 gram/100 ml.
Anemia is caused by either a decrease in production of red blood cells or hemoglobin, or an increase in loss (usually due to bleeding) or destruction of red blood cells.
Some patients with anemia have no symptoms. Those that do have symptoms mayfeel tired,become easily fatigued,appear pale,have a feeling of a heart racing,feel short of breath, and/orhave worsening heart problems.
