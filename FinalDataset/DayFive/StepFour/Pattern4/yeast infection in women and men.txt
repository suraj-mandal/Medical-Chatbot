Most vaginal yeast infections are caused by the organism Candida albicans.
Yeast infections are very common and affect up to 75% of women at some point in their lifetime.
The main symptom of a vaginal yeast infection is itching, but burning, discharge, and pain with urination or intercourse can also occur.
Treatment involves topical or oral antifungal medications.
It is possible for a woman to transmit a yeast infection to a male sex partner, even though yeast infection is not considered to be a true sexually-transmitted disease (STD) because it can occur in women who are not sexually active.
Treatment of yeast infection in men, like in women, involves antifungal medications.
Keeping the vaginal area dry and avoiding irritating chemicals can help prevent yeast infections in women. Consuming foods with probiotics also may help.
