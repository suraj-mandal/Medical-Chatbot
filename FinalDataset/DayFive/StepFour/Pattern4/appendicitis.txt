The appendix is a small, worm-like, tubular appendage attached to the cecum of the colon.
Appendicitis is caused by the blockage of the appendix followed by invasion of bacteria of the wall of the appendix.Â 
The most common complications of appendicitis are rupture, abscess, and peritonitis.
The most common signs and symptoms of appendicitis in adults and children areabdominal pain,loss of appetite,nausea and vomiting,fever, andabdominal tenderness.

Appendicitis usually is suspected on the basis of a patient's history and physical examination; however, a white blood cell count, urinalysis, abdominal X-ray, barium enema, ultrasonography, computerized tomography (CT) scan, and laparoscopy also may be helpful in diagnosis.
Due to the varying size and location of the appendix and the proximity of other organs to the appendix, it may be difficult to differentiate appendicitis from other abdominal and pelvic diseases or even during the onset of labor during pregnancy.
The treatment for appendicitis usually is antibiotics and appendectomy (surgery to remove the appendix).
Complications of appendectomy include wound infection and abscess.
Other conditions that can mimic appendicitis include celicac disese Meckel's diverticulitis, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), inflammatory diseases of the right upper abdomen (gallbladder disease, liver disease, or perforated duodenal ulcer), right-sided diverticulitis, ectopic pregnancy, kidney diseases, and Crohn's disease of the terminal ileum.
