Chiggers are barely visible to the naked eye (their length is less than 1/150th of an inch). A magnifying glass may be needed to see them. They are red in color and may be best appreciated when clustered in groups on the skin. The juvenile forms have six legs, although the (harmless) adult mites have eight legs.
Chiggers are the larval (juvenile) form of a type of mite (Trombiculidae).
Chiggers do not burrow into and remain inside the skin, contrary to popular belief.
Chiggers inject digestive enzymes into the skin and feed upon the decomposed tissue.
Pronounced itching is the main symptom of chigger bites.
Bites may appear as blisters or as flat or raised red areas.
Treatment involves supportive measures to control itching.
