Jaundice is a yellowish discoloration of the skin, mucous membranes and of the white of the eyes caused by elevated levels of the chemical bilirubin in the blood (hyperbilirubinemia). The term jaundice is derived from the French word jaune, which means yellow. Jaundice is not a disease per se, but rather a visible sign of an underlying disease process.
Jaundice is typically seen when the level of bilirubin in the blood exceeds 2.5-3 mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter).
Jaundice in adults can be caused by a variety of medical conditions, some of which are serious and potentially life-threatening.
Any adult who develops jaundice needs to undergo a comprehensive medical evaluation in order to determine its cause.
Neonatal jaundice, a condition seen in newborns, is most often a benign condition that improves without serious after effects).
