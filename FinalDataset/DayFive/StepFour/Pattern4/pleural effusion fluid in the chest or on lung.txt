A pleural effusion is a buildup of fluid in the pleural space, an area between the layers of tissue that line the lungs and the chest wall. It may also be referred to as effusion or pulmonary effusion. The type of fluid that forms a pleural effusion may be categorized as either transudate or exudate.

Transudate is usually composed of ultrafiltrates of plasma due to an imbalance in vascular hydrostatic and oncotic forces in the chest (heart failure, cirrhosis).
Exudate is typically produced by inflammatory conditions (lung infection, lung cancer). Exudative pleural effusions are usually more serious and difficult to treat.
