The bones in the foot may be broken in many ways including direct blows, crush injuries, falls and overuse or stress.
Signs and symptoms of a broken foot may include pain, limping, swelling, bruising, and refusal to bear weight on the affected foot.
Initial treatment may include RICE (rest, ice, compression, elevation). Rest may include the use of crutches to limit weight bearing.
X-rays often help make the diagnosis but bone scan or computerized tomography (CT scan) may be needed to help visualize the injury.
Treatment of foot fractures depend upon which bone is broken but many fractures are treated with a compression dressing, a stiff-soled shoe, boot, and weight bearing as tolerated.
Some foot fractures require surgery to repair the damage.
Complications of foot fractures include non-union at the fracture site, arthritis if a joint is involved, and infection if the skin is broken.
Healing and recovery time for a broken foot depends upon the type of fracture and the bone(s) involved.
