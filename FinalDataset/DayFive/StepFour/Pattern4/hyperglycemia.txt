The medical definition of hyperglycemia or high blood sugar, is an abnormally high blood level in the blood. Hyperglycemia is a hallmark sign of diabetes (both type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes) and prediabetes, and diabetes is the most common cause of it. Severely elevated glucose levels can result in a medical emergency like diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome (HHNS, also referred to as hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state).
The primary symptom of hyperglycemia is excessive amounts of sugar (glucose) in the urine. Hyperglycemias main symptoms are an increased thirst and the need to urinate often. Other symptoms and signs of high blood sugar levels in the blood are blurred vision, hunger ("hangry"), and headaches.
Other conditions that can cause high blood sugar are pancreatitis, Cushing's syndrome, unusual hormone-secreting tumors, pancreatic cancer, certain medications, and severe illnesses.
Insulin is the treatment for people with type 1 diabetes, and for life-threatening increases in glucose levels. People with type 2 diabetes may be managed with a combination of different oral and injectable medications. Hyperglycemia due to medical conditions other than diabetes is generally treated by treating the underlying condition responsible for the elevated glucose.
