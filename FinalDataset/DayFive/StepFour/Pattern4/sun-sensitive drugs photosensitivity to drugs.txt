Photosensitivity (or sun sensitivity) is inflammation of the skin induced by the combination of sunlight and certain medications or substances. This causes redness of the skin and may look similar to sunburn. Both the photosensitizing medication or chemical and light source have to be present in order for a photosensitivity reaction to occur.
Generally, these reactions can be divided into two mechanisms:
Phototoxic drugs are much more common than photoallergic drugs.

Sun-sensitive or photosensitive drugs are drugs that cause a moderate to severe skin reaction that is similar to a bad sunburn when the exposed to the sun (UV rays), usually the forehead, nose, hands, arms, and lips. Many common medications cause this reaction in some people.
Usually, the allergic reaction appears within 24 hours of sun exposure and resolves when the blisters from the rash peel and slough off.

The photoallergic reactions may happen after several days of exposure to sun. Ultraviolet exposure causes the body's immune system to see a drug as an invader (antigen). The immune system initiates an allergic response and causes inflammation of the skin in the sun-exposed areas. Photoallergic reactions resemble eczema and are generally chronic.
