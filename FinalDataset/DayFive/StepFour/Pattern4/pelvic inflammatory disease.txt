Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection and inflammation of a woman's pelvic organs including the uterus (womb), Fallopian tubes (tubes), ovaries, and cervix.
PID is very common and is estimated to affect around 1 million women every year in the US.
Pelvic inflammatory disease usually develops as the result of spread of a 
	sexually-transmitted disease (STD).
Most cases of pelvic inflammatory disease are caused by 
	gonorrhea and/or 
	Chlamydia, although several different types of bacteria can be responsible.
Young, sexually active women with multiple sex partners are at greatest risk for pelvic inflammatory disease. 
	Douching and a history of PID are other risk factors.
Pelvic inflammatory disease many not produce any symptoms or signs (referred to as being asymptomatic). In other cases it can cause 
	
		
		fever, 
		
		abdominal or
		pelvic pain, 
		
		
		vaginal discharge, 
		
		painful urination, or 
		painful sexual intercourse.
