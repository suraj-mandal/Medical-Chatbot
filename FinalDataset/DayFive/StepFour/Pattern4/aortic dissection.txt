Can aortic dissection be prevented?
Aortic dissection occurs when a tear occurs in the inner muscle wall lining of the aorta, allowing blood to split apart the muscle layers of the aortic wall.
Symptoms of aortic dissection include a tearing or ripping pain in the chest, sweating, nausea, shortness of breath, weakness, or syncope (fainting). Abdominal aortic dissection can present with abdominal pain radiating to the flank or back.
There are two types of dissection: Type A is treated surgically, while type B is treated with medical management.
Mortality is high for both types of aortic dissection. 
Reducing the risk factors for aortic dissection, such as high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol, diabetes, and quitting smoking are key to prevention of this condition.
