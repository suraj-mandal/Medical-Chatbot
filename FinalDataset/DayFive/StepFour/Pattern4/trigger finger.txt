Trigger finger is a "snapping" or "locking" condition of any of the digits of the hand when opening or closing. Stenosing tenosynovitis is the medical term for trigger finger.


Local swelling from inflammation or scarring of the tendon sheath (tenosynovium) around the flexor tendons causes trigger finger. These tendons normally pull the affected digit inward toward the palm (flexion). When they are inflamed, they tend to catch where they normally slide through the tendon sheath.


Usually, trigger finger occurs as an isolated condition because of repetitive trauma. Activities such as gardening, pruning, and clipping, etc., are risk factors for trigger finger. Sometimes, trigger finger is an associated condition resulting from an underlying illness or medical condition that causes inflammation of tissues of the hand, such as rheumatoid arthritis. In fact, data presented at the 2005 American College of Rheumatology national meeting suggested that a majority of patients with rheumatoid arthritis have inflammation around the tendons of the palm of the hand that could develop into trigger finger. Trigger finger most often affects the right or left index finger, the digits likely to pull the trigger on a gun.
