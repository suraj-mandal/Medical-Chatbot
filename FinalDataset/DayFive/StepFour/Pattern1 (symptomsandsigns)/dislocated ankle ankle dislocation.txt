A dislocated ankle is an accidental injury and most often cannot be prevented.
The risk factors are few:
Recurrent sprained ankles that cause the joint to be lax
Weakness of the muscles that surround and support the ankle, especially the peroneal muscle
Diseases that cause joints to be hypermobile (for example, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome, Down syndrome)
