Once a synovectomy for plant thorn arthritis has been performed, the joint tends to heal well without residual problems. The sooner the synovectomy is performed, the better the outcome as chronic joint inflammation can risk damage to cartilage of the joint. Physical therapy rehabilitation exercises can be helpful to restore normal joint function.


Plant thorn arthritis can be prevented by avoiding exposure to the thorns of plants. It can help to wear protective clothing, gloves, etc., as well as being cautious when near or working with thorny plants.
