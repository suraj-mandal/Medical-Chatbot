First, one can do certain things to get ready to quit. Then, there are other 
things to do on the day of quitting. Finally, one can do things to help oneself 
to remain abstinent. (This is the hardest part.) 




Set a date for quitting. If possible, plan to have a 
  friend quit smoking with you. 
 It's best to pick a day within the next month. A date too far off in the future 
 will give you a chance to procrastinate and postpone, while a date too soon may 
 not allow you to make a plan for medications or support systems.
Notice when and why you smoke. Try to find the things 
  in your daily life that you often do while smoking (such as drinking your 
  morning cup of coffee or driving a car). 
 
Change your smoking routines: Keep your cigarettes in 
  a different place. Smoke with your other hand. Don't do anything else when you 
  are smoking. Think about how you feel when you smoke. 
 
Smoke only in certain places, such as outdoors.  
 
When you want a cigarette, wait a few minutes. Try to 
  think of something to do instead of smoking. For example, you might chew gum 
  or drink a glass of water. 
 
Buy one pack of cigarettes at a time. Switch to a 
brand of cigarettes that you don't like.

Get rid of all your cigarettes. Put away your 
  ashtrays. 
Change your morning routine. When you eat breakfast, 
  don't sit in the same place at the kitchen table. Stay busy. 
 
When you get the urge to smoke, do something else 
  instead. 
 
Carry other things to put in your mouth, such as gum, 
  hard candy, or a toothpick. 
 
Reward yourself at the end of the day for not 
smoking. See a movie or go out and enjoy your favorite meal. 
Tell your friends and family members about your decision to quit 
	smoking, and ask for their support.
