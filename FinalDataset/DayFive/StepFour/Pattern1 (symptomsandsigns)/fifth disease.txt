Parvovirus B19 usually spreads by droplets. The virus spreads whenever an infected person coughs or sneezes. However, once the rash is present, that person is usually no longer contagious and need not be isolated.


Similar to most viral illnesses, the best way to prevent the spread of the disease is by proper hand washing, by covering your mouth and nose when you sneeze or cough, and by staying home when you become sick.
