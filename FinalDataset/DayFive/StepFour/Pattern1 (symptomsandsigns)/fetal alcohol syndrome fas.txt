In addition to fetal alcohol syndrome, there are three other conditions associated with fetal exposure to alcohol. These include the following:


While no cure exists for fetal alcohol syndrome, early intervention programs have been shown to lessen the impact of language, motor, and cognitive impairments. Such aggressive programs utilize physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and educational therapy to maximize benefit. Adolescents and adults may benefit from programs dealing with academic, legal, and psychiatric problems.


Many of the issues faced by infants and children with FAS continue into adolescence and adulthood. These may include:
More unique to adolescents and adults are issues with sexual behavior, legal problems, and substance abuse. It is often observed that the characteristic facial features noted in infancy and childhood seem to "soften" with age. A small-sized head and short stature do continue into adulthood.
Requirements for partial FAS with confirmed maternal alcohol exposure: confirmed fetal alcohol exposure; characteristic facial abnormalities; either growth retardation, brain neurodevelopmental findings, other unexplained behavioral abnormalities and alcohol-related birth defects
Requirements for alcohol-related birth defects: confirmed maternal alcohol exposure, birth defects and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders
Requirements for alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder: confirmed maternal alcohol exposure and either neurodevelopmental abnormalities or other unexplained behavioral abnormalities
problems with "regulation" (sleeping, attention, and arousal),
learning disorders,
impairment with vision and hearing,
mental retardation,
deficits in memory, reasoning, and judgment.
