Dry eye syndrome is more common with increasing age, female sex, and Asian ethnicity. Menopause can increase the risk of dry eye syndrome. Paradoxically, postmenopausal women on hormone replacement therapy, especially estrogens alone, have a higher prevalence of dry eyes than postmenopausal women who don't take hormones.
Occupational and environmental factors increasing risk include low humidity, high room temperature, wind exposure, pollution and poor air quality, smoking, and decreased blink rates due to sustained computer use or reading.
Diseases associated with dry eyes include vitamin A deficiency (historically known as xerophthalmia), acne rosacea, autoimmune/connective tissue disease, hepatitis C infection, HIV infection, Sj√∂gren's syndrome, sarcoidosis, diabetes mellitus, and androgen or estrogen deficiency.
Wearing contact lenses increases the risk of dry eye syndrome. Refractive surgery, especially LASIK, frequently causes dry eyes.
A diet low in omega-3 fatty acids or a diet with a relatively high amount of omega-6 fatty acids relative to omega-3 fatty acids can also increase the risk of dry eye syndrome.
Various types of medications, including systemic chemotherapy, diuretics, antidepressants, antihistamines and beta-adrenergic blockers, may cause dry eyes as a side effect of the medication.
Irregularities of the conjunctival surface as seen with pingueculae or pterygia, can cause dry eye symptoms. Abnormalities of the blink mechanism or mechanical lid abnormalities can also produce DES symptoms.
