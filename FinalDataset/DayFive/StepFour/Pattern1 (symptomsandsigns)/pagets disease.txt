Paget's disease is treated by generalists, including general and family medicine doctors and internists, as well as specialists including rheumatologists, orthopedic surgeons, and otolaryngologists (ENT physicians) for hearing loss. Frequently, the care of individuals with Paget's disease is a coordinated effort between several health care professionals depending on its location, symptoms, and complications.


Health care professionals make a diagnosis of Paget's disease based on the X-ray appearance. Doctors also may detect Paget's disease with other imaging tests, such as a bone scan, MRI scan, and CT scan to make a diagnosis. Alkaline phosphatase, an enzyme that comes from bone, is frequently elevated in the blood of people with Paget's disease as a result of the abnormal bone turnover of actively remodeling bone. This blood test is also referred to as the serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP) and is used to monitor the results of treatment of Paget's disease.
The bone scan is particularly helpful in determining the extent of the involvement of Paget's disease as it provides an image of the entire skeleton. Bone that is affected by Paget's disease can easily be identified with bone scanning images. A bone biopsy is generally not necessary to make the diagnosis of Paget's disease. Bone biopsy would be considered if there was a suspicion of cancer or abnormal lesion in the involved bone.
