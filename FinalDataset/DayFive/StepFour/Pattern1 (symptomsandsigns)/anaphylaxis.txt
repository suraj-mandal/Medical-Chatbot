Anaphylaxis often affects two or more body systems, or it may present with just low blood pressure (hypotension), which usually occurs with a severe reaction. Although the symptoms of an anaphylactic reaction usually occur within seconds to minutes after exposure to a trigger, some reactions can occur up to two hours after the exposure. Possible symptoms and signs of an anaphylactic reaction include:
Skin symptoms: itching, flushing, hives, and swelling (angioedema)
Gastrointestinal symptoms: abdominal pain, abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea
Respiratory symptoms: nasal congestion, runny nose, cough, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and wheezing
Cardiovascular symptoms: dizziness, lightheadedness, fast heart rate (tachycardia), and low blood pressure
Additionally, those affected often report a "feeling of impending doom."
There is no testing to predict the severity of an anaphylactic reaction, though a previous severe reaction raises the risk of a subsequent severe reaction. Uncontrolled asthma is a consistent risk factor for severe anaphylaxis and fatal anaphylaxis. A history of environmental allergies, eczema (atopic dermatitis), or asthma may also raise the risk of anaphylaxis.
