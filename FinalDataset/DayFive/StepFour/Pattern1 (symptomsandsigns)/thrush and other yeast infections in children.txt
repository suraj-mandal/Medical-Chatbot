There are some situations when a child may need a different medication to clear a yeast infection. A health care provider may prescribe another type of antifungal cream or oral preparation that may include ketoconazole (Nizoral, Extina, Xolegel, Kuric), fluconazole (Diflucan), or itraconazole (Sporanox).


There is no need to remove a child with yeast infection from childcare. Since most healthy people already harbor Candida, children with thrush and Candida diaper rash do not have to be excluded from child care (as long they are able to participate comfortably).
Childcare providers should follow good hygiene, including careful hand washing and disposal of nasal and oral secretions of children with thrush, in order to avoid transmitting the infection to children who may not already be infected.
