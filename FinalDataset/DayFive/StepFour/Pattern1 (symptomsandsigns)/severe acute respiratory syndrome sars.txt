The time between getting infected and the start of symptoms (the incubation period) is about 
two to seven days but occasionally has been up to 14 days.




SARS-CoV can infect a person regardless of their health status or age group. However, it was clear that some people were at increased risk during the 2002-2003 outbreak. This included people over the age of 50 (some reported mortality rates of about 50%), pregnant women, and those with underlying diabetes, heart disease, or liver disease. A major risk factor is simply close association with any person infected with SARS-CoV since the virus can be spread through droplets sprayed into the air by coughing, sneezing, or even talking.
Other risk factors include the following:
Recent travel to mainland China, Hong Kong, or Taiwan or close contact with ill people 
with a history of recent travel to these areas
Employment in an occupation at risk for SARS-CoV exposure, including a health-care worker with direct contact with a patient having SARS-CoV, or a worker in a laboratory that contains live SARS-CoV
Relationship with a cluster of cases of atypical pneumonia without an alternative diagnosis
