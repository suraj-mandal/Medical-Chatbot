The consequences of childhood obesity may be grouped into three areas: physical, mental, and economic. The known physical side effects of obesity are multiple and broad spectrum in character. These include the following:
Equally as important as these physical side effects of obesity are the psychological consequences, which include the following:
The economic costs of childhood obesity are not often considered but are very important. Such effects include the following:
Increase in risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus due to excessive insulin secretion and organ resistance to insulin
Menstrual irregularity and infertility
Heart attack and stroke due to hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension
Pulmonary issues centering on asthma and obstructive sleep apnea
Orthopedic issues of bowed legs and hip instability (for example, slipped capital femoral epiphysis)
Metabolic issues (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, gallstones, and gastroesophageal reflux [GERD])
Lowering of self-esteem often reinforced by teasing and bullying at school as well as a recurring barrage of the normal/ideal physique displayed by the media and entertainment industries
Depression, leading to possible further eating or an exaggerated overcorrection leading to eating disorders such as bulimia and anorexia nervosa
The direct costs of medical office visits, diagnostic studies, and therapeutic services
Indirect costs are both long- and short-term and include decrease in productivity, absenteeism, and premature death. Researchers estimate that over $147 billion are spent annually on the direct and indirect costs associated with obesity.
