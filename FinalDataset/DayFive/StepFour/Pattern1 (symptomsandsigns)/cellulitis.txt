Cellulitis may occur anywhere on the body; the legs are a common location. The lower leg is the most common site of the infection (particularly in the area of the tibia or shinbone and in the foot; see the illustration below), followed by the arm, and then the head and neck areas. In special circumstances, such as following surgery or trauma wounds, cellulitis can develop in the abdomen or chest areas. People with morbid obesity can also develop cellulitis in the abdominal skin. Special types of cellulitis are sometimes designated by the location of the infection. Examples include periorbital and orbital cellulitis (around the eye socket), buccal (cheek) cellulitis, facial cellulitis, and perianal cellulitis.
