There are no home remedies for actinic keratoses, but many will resolve spontaneously if sun exposure can be strictly limited. Those lesions that do not resolve need professional medical attention.


Sun avoidance is the simplest way to avoid actinic keratoses. This would include applications of SPF 50 sunscreens to exposed skin, wearing sun-protective clothing, shade-seeking behavior, and avoiding tanning. There is now some evidence that taking niacinamide (nicotinamide), not niacin, may have some preventative benefit. Niacinamide is available at many health food stores. Concerns about vitamin D deficiency can be avoided by taking multivitamin supplements.


Patients who develop actinic keratoses should be examined at least once yearly. Actinic keratoses are an indicator that sufficient sun exposure has occurred to produce skin cancers such as basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and malignant melanoma. The purpose of these regular checks is to prevent and detect the development of invasive skin cancer. Furthermore, continual avoidance of excessive sun exposure can decrease the risk of recurrences.
