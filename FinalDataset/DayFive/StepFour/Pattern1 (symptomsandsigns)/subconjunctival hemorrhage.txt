A health care provider will take a medical history and medication history to determine what events were leading up to the subconjunctival hemorrhage and will also perform an examination. Vital signs including blood pressure may also be checked.
If trauma was the cause, a more thorough examination will usually be performed.
In newborn infants, subconjunctival hemorrhage can occasionally be found as a result of the birth process.


Your primary care provider or ophthalmologist can make the diagnosis. That physician can also order tests if you have a recent history of easy bruising.


Because of the benign nature of most subconjunctival hemorrhage, there is no need for home remedies.
