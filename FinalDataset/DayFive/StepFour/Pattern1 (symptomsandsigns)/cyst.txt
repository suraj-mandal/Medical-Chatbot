The type of healthcare provider who treats cysts depend on the underlying cause of the cyst and the symptoms, if any, that are produced by the cyst. Usually a primary care doctor is the first one who should be consulted when you notice a cyst. For example, a small epidermoid cyst that causes no symptoms would not require treatment. However, a large cyst in the abdomen displacing internal organs would require a surgeon to remove it. Consequently, many different physician specialists may be involved (OB/GYN, surgeon, orthopedic, gastroenterologist, ENT, dermatologist, infectious disease, or oncologist, for example) depending on the cyst's size, location, composition, and underlying cause.


Some cysts are easily palpated by the doctor, especially if the cysts are located in the skin or in organs that are readily palpable, like the thyroid gland. Imaging studies such as ultrasound, X-ray, CAT scans, and MRIs are very useful in finding cysts. In addition, needle biopsies are sometimes used to determine if malignant tissue is associated with a cyst-like structure. In addition, needle biopsy may be used to reduce the size of the cyst.
