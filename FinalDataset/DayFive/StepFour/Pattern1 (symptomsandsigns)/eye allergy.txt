Eye allergies mainly involve the conjunctiva, which is the tissue lining (mucus membrane) that covers the white surface of the eyeball and the inner folds of the eyelids. The conjunctiva is a barrier structure that is exposed to the environment and the many different allergens (substances that stimulate an allergic response) that become airborne. It is rich in blood vessels and contains more mast cells (cells that release histamine, a chemical mediator of allergic reactions) than the lungs.
The lacrimal (tear) glands are located in the upper and outer portions of the eye. They are responsible for producing the watery part of tears, which keeps the eye moist and washes away irritants. The tears also contain important parts of the immune defense such as immunoglobulins (antibodies), lymphocytes (specialized white blood cells), and enzymes.
The cornea is the transparent sheath in front of the lens of the eye. The cornea has no blood vessels and very little immune activity.
