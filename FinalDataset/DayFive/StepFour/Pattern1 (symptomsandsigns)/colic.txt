It is critically important to consult the baby's doctor at the very beginning of the suspected colic symptoms. While there are no tests that doctors can perform where the results come back "colic," it is very important to exclude several other causes of crying or sudden-onset screaming in a newborn. Remember that other less serious causes of crying include anything that causes discomfort. Check if the infant is hungry, too cold or too warm, over-tired or suffering from food intolerance (gassy, overly loose stool that may be a sign of lactose or milk protein intolerance). Other more serious medical conditions to consider include intestinal blockage or obstruction, abdominal infection, a hernia, a scratch of the baby's eye, an ear infection, a bladder infection, hair or fiber wrapped around fingers or toes, and others. Once the baby receives a clean bill of health, an understanding, supportive doctor is worth his/her weight in gold! Should a colicky baby's symptoms ever suddenly change, the doctor will reassess the situation and look for unrelated problems that can arise in any baby. As discussed above, the doctor may recommend an over-the-counter anti-gas bubble medicine for the baby (for example, simethicone or Mylicon Drops) or even a probiotic. Babies take these medications orally. When it seems that there are as many home remedies or "cures" for colic as there are grandparents, always call the baby's doctor first. Finally, remember that after the three or four months, the colic resolves; there are no long-term problems associated with colic.
