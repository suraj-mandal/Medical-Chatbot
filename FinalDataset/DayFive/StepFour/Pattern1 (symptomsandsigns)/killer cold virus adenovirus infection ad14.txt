Unfortunately, the contagious period for this virus begins when the virus sheds in respiratory droplets and feces. This can begin in the incubation period and can continue shedding for months after the person has recovered and has no signs or symptoms of the illness.


Most infections last about five days (range is about three to seven days). Severe infections may last two or more weeks.


Adenovirus 14 infections usually begin with cold symptoms such as:
The majority of infected people have these types of symptoms for several days (about three to five days), and then the respiratory tract infection clears without any medical treatment. However, with some individuals, infection with the adenovirus 14 strain (and rarely a few other strains such as 3, 7, 21, 30) progresses past the three to five days, causing additional symptoms. These symptoms may include:
Although medical professionals have found infection with Ad14 in a few isolated individuals, most recent outbreaks have occurred with groups of individuals living in close contact. For example, the 2007 outbreak occurred in a military installation (Lackland AFB) in San Antonio, TX, while the 2008 outbreak was in a small community in Alaska. A group of individuals that appears very ill (require hospitalization) due to respiratory problems, and are likely due to a "virus," should make clinicians suspect Ad14 as a possible cause of infection.
