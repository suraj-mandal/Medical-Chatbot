Signs and symptoms of someone who has been sexually assaulted or raped tend to include depression, guilt, anger, and anxiety. Behaviorally, the victim of sexual violence might become aggressive, abuse substances, or break rules, like not attending work or school. The victim might also have sleeping or eating problems, withdrawal from relationships, or intrinsic sexual problems.


Some ways to prevent sexual assault and rape are to lessen the life risk factors for being the victim or perpetrator of these crimes. While risk factors such as being less than 15 years old and being in a married or cohabitating relationship are not amenable to change, refraining from the use of drugs or alcohol and decreasing the number of sexual partners may help decrease the vulnerability to sexual victimization. The fact that perpetrators of rape or other sexual assault are often drunk or intoxicated with another substance at the time of the assault indicates that such offenses are frequently facilitated by substance abuse. While increased female empowerment sometimes places women at increased risk for spousal sexual violence, helping women improve their socioeconomic status or to achieving careers outside of sex work (for example, in prostitution, adult entertainment, or what many interpret to be other forms of sexual exploitation) may decrease their risk for rape or other forms of sexual assault.
Factors that tend to decrease the likelihood that men will engage in committing a rape include individual issues such as refraining from the use of drugs or alcohol, exercising good impulse control, and having good perceptions of women (e.g. family factors such as having a supportive family and absence of domestic violence). Community factors such as low crime rates in general and having strong laws against sexual violence can also mitigate male-instigated sexual violence.
