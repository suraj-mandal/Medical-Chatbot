Most commonly, urologists manage urethral strictures. Urologists are doctors with training and specialization in the urinary system.


Doctors make a diagnosis based on history, physical examination, and one or more studies to determine the location and extent of the stricture.
When the medical history, physical examination, and symptoms are suggestive of urethral stricture, additional diagnostic tests may be helpful in further evaluation. Urinalysis (UA), urine culture, and urethral culture for sexually transmitted infections diseases (gonorrhea, chlamydia) are some of the tests that physicians may order. A doctor may examine the prostate and screen for prostate cancer (manual exam and measurement of prostate specific antigen or PSA) depending on the history, symptoms, and age of the male. A uroflow study may be obtained, whereby one urinates into a special collection container that can measure the rate of the flow of urine and the pattern of the urine stream. In addition, an ultrasound like machine, a bladder scanner assesses the amount of urine left in the bladder (postvoid residual).
Oftentimes, imaging and endoscopic studies are necessary to confirm the diagnosis and identify the location, length, and extent of the narrowing from the stricture.
