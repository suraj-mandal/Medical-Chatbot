Doctors who treat Baker's cysts include general primary care physicians, orthopedists, and rheumatologists.


Baker's cysts can be diagnosed by the doctor's examination and confirmed by imaging tests (either ultrasound, injection of contrast dye into the knee followed by imaging, called an arthrogram, or MRI scan) if necessary. Health care professionals can rule out other causes of swelling behind the knee (including deep vein thrombosis, popliteal aneurysm, and neuroma) using these imaging tests.
