The incubation period (the time from infection to symptoms) is about 14 to 21 days after contact with the virus. Chickenpox is characterized by general weakness, fever up to 102 F, and red spots that start on the same day or so as the fever. The spots rapidly develop into blister-like skin lesions with surrounding redness. Rash usually starts on the head or trunk (the area where most of the rash appears) and spreads to the arms and legs. The blisters may spread to mucous membranes and produce ulcers inside the eyelids, mouth, throat, and genital area. Any area of skin that is irritated (by diaper rash, poison ivy, eczema, sunburn, etc.) is likely to be hard hit by the rash. The rash is typically very itchy (pruritic) and develops in groups of new blisters even as older blisters begin to dry up. Over five to seven days, all of the blisters dry up and become crusted, and the illness is over.
The chickenpox rash is very typical, and diagnosis is usually made based on symptoms and appearance of the rash without having to do any tests. However, people with immune system problems may have an atypical case. In situations where the rash is unclear, fluid or tissue biopsy from a blister or sore can be tested for VZV DNA by PCR.
