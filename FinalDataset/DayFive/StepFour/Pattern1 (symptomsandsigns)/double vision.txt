Eye doctors (optometrists and ophthalmologists) can perform the assessment and treat underlying ocular diseases. The primary care doctor (family practitioner, internist, or pediatrician) is often involved when an underlying systemic is causing the double vision. In some cases, specialists such as neurologists, endocrinologists, and neurosurgeons may also be called upon to provide treatment.


If the underlying cause is preventable, your physician will suggest ways to minimize chance of recurrence.


The prognosis is dependent on the underlying cause. Monocular diplopia due to blurred vision has a good prognosis as long as the underlying cause of the blur is correctable. Binocular diplopia may resolve with treatment of the underlying cause, however, in some instances, there may be permanent misalignment of the eyes due to nerve or muscle damage or scarring. If surgical realignment is insufficient or not an option, glasses with prisms might help in some cases.
