In many cases, antibiotics and pain medications effectively treat osteomyelitis. If a doctor obtains a biopsy, this can help guide the choice of the best antibiotic. The duration of treatment of osteomyelitis with antibiotics is usually four to eight weeks but varies with the type of infection and the response to the treatments. In some cases, the doctor will immobilize an affected area with a brace to reduce the pain and speed the treatment.
Sometimes, surgery may be necessary. If there is an area of localized bacteria (bone abscess) or joint infection (septic arthritis), a doctor may need to open, wash, and drain it. If there is damaged soft tissue or bone, this may need to be removed (debridement). If it's necessary to remove bone, it may need to be replaced with bone graft or stabilized during surgery.


With early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, the prognosis for osteomyelitis is good. A patient will need to adhere to antibiotics regimes for four to eight weeks and sometimes longer in the treatment of osteomyelitis depending on the bacteria that caused it and the response of the patient. Commonly, patients can make a full recovery without longstanding complications.
However, if there is a long delay in diagnosis or treatment, or if there is significant bone and soft tissue injury due to trauma with compromised local blood supply, it can lead to long-term permanent functional deficits and/or make the patient more prone to reoccurrence. If it's necessary to perform surgery, debridement, or bone grafting, this will prolong the time it takes to recover.
