Bursitis of the knee can occur when the bursa fills with blood from injury and overuse, such as from athletic competition. Bursitis can also occur from rheumatoid arthritis and from deposits of crystals, as seen in patients with gouty arthritis and pseudogout. The prepatellar bursa can also become infected with bacteria (septic bursitis). When this happens, fever may be present. This type of infection usually occurs from breaks in the overlying skin or puncture wounds. The bacterium involved in septic bursitis of the knee is usually Staphylococcus, which is normally present on the skin. Rarely, a chronically inflamed bursa can become infected by bacteria spreading through the blood.
