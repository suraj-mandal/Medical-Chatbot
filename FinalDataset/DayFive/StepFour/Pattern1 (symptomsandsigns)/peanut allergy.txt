It is not clear why the rate of peanut allergy is increasing in the United States and other westernized nations. This is an area of active medical research. Risk factors for peanut allergy include a personal or family history of allergic conditions, such as asthma, hay fever (allergic rhinitis), and particularly eczema (atopic dermatitis). A sibling of a child with peanut allergy has approximately a 7% chance of developing peanut allergy, as compared to the baseline population risk of 0.5%. Other factors influencing peanut allergy include exposure during pregnancy and lactation, exposure to peanut protein through household dust, and exposure to skin-care products containing crude peanut oil.
There has been significant recent research on the timing of peanut exposure into a child's diet and its effect on the risk of allergy. In the early 2000s, recommendations were to delay the introduction of peanuts until 3 years of age. The rates of peanut allergy more than doubled in countries following these recommendations. It was also observed that rates of peanut allergy were significantly lower in countries, such as Israel, where children were introduced to peanuts at a younger age. In 2008, the recommendation regarding delayed introduction of peanut was retracted, and research began to indicate that earlier introduction of peanut may be protective against food allergy. In a landmark study publish in 2015 (LEAP study), it was shown that early introduction of peanut into a child's diet, at 4 months of age, significantly decreased the risk of developing peanut allergy in a high-risk population. This study, along with additional research, may very well lead to updated guidelines on the timing of introduction of peanuts and other highly allergenic foods into a child's diet.
