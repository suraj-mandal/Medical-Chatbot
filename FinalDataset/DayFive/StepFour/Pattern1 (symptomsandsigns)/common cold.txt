There are various risk factors that may increase the chances of acquiring the common cold, including the following:
Age: Infants and young children are more likely to develop the common cold because they have not yet developed immunity to many of the implicated viruses.
Seasonal variation: Individuals more commonly acquire the common cold during the fall, winter, or during the rainy season (in warmer climates). This is felt to occur because people tend to stay indoors and are in closer proximity to one another.
Weakened immune system: Individuals with a poorly functioning immune system are more likely to develop the common cold. Also, individuals with excessive fatigue or emotional distress may be more susceptible to catching the common cold.
