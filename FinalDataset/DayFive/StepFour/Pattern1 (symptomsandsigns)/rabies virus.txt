Once the symptoms of rabies start, the disease is nearly universally fatal.


Rabies prevention is mostly about good pet care and outdoor behavior. Vaccinate pets and keep them away from outdoor and wild animals. Don't approach wild animals. Keep bats out of the home, and stay away from areas with bats (caves).
When traveling, be aware of stray animals.
If spending significant time in a country where rabies is common, one should consider rabies vaccination.
