Home remedies are aimed at relieving pain and swelling. These home treatments include the following:
It has been suggested that raw garlic applied directly to the cyst may help with infection, however, it can be extremely irritating to the skin and the open wound. Talk to your doctor before using any herbal supplement or natural remedy as some may interact with medications you are on. In addition, if your cyst has been drained and is open, you need to follow your doctor's instructions.
Sitz baths: Sitting in a tub of warm water up to the hips can relieve pain and may reduce the chances the cyst will worsen.
Vitamin C and zinc supplements can help in the healing process. Vitamin A also helps with tissue repair. Consult a doctor for the right dose of these supplements.
Essential oils, such as tea tree oil and sage oil, may help soothe the cyst and may even help fight infection.
A product called No Bump Rx helps prevent ingrown hairs.
Castor oil applied to the cyst may help reduce inflammation.
A coccyx cushion or pillow can provide support and comfort while sitting.
Regular exercise helps improve blood flow, which can aid in healing.
