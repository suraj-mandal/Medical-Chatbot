If the obstructed gland has bacteria within it, the gland may become infected. This is a hordeolum, which does resemble a pimple, which really is an infected obstruction of an oil gland of the skin. A hordeolum may be tender to touch and resemble a pustule elsewhere in the body. A chalazion is not an infection but may follow or precede a hordeolum. Hordeolum is another name for a stye.


A doctor uses a patient's medical history and the finding of a firm painless lump in one of the eyelids to diagnose a chalazion. This diagnosis can be made by inspection with a penlight and some source of magnification together with palpation (feeling) of the lump. The diagnosis of a chalazion includes investigating other causes of lid lumps, including benign and malignant growths. Your physician will suggest a biopsy if he or she suspects that the lump might be a tumor.
