If the scalp is involved as part of severe psoriasis deemed too extensive to be treated practically with topical medications, then medications delivered orally or by injection may be necessary. All these medications comprise more risk when compared to topical medication. They include oral drugs like methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall), cyclosporine (Sandimmune), acitretin (Soriatane), apremilast (Otezla), and some of the so-called biological drugs that are administered by infusion into a vein (infliximab [Remicade]) or by injection into the deeper layers of the skin like etanercept (Enbrel), adalimumab (Humira), ustekinumab (Stelara), secukinumab (Cosentyx), and ixekizumab (Taltz). Regular laboratory work may be necessary to monitor for the toxicities associated with some of these systemic therapies.


Since psoriasis is incurable unless there is a miraculous spontaneous resolution, those afflicted need to remember that constant care is required to keep it controlled. With diligent attention, scalp psoriasis can be controlled.


Patient support groups like the National Psoriasis Foundation are valuable additions to medical care that can aid individuals dealing with the disease.
