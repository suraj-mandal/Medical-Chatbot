The person must have a history of an infection with group A streptococcal bacteria, either by laboratory documentation (for example, a positive rapid strep test) or positive strep culture, and must have two major or one major and two minor revised Jones criteria findings.


The first step in treating rheumatic fever is to eradicate the bacteria (usually with penicillin) that initially caused the immunologic response. For penicillin-allergic patients, there are other options such as erythromycin azithromycin or a member of the cephalosporin family. It is important to make sure that patients receive treatment for the acute infection, but such treatment won't necessarily change the course of rheumatic fever once the immunologic response has begun. Your doctor will decide on the best treatment option for you. Aspirin or aspirin-related medications treat the joint pains. It may be necessary to use very high doses to decrease the symptoms. (Caution: Do not routinely use aspirin in pediatric patients because of its association with Reye's syndrome.) Consult a pediatric specialist for treatment protocols.
High-dose steroids treat carditis, but it may be necessary to use other cardiac medications to control the inflammation of the heart. Health care professionals initially manage this serious condition in a hospital.
The most challenging and unpredictable symptom to treat is the chorea (involuntary movements). It often responds to antipsychotic medications such as haloperidol (Haldol) but may continue for a protracted period. For patients who develop Sydenham's chorea, it can be the most difficult of the symptoms, since it involves involuntary movements and can interfere with daily activities. These individuals must remain on chronic long-term antibiotics to prevent recurrence of the strep infection, as a recurrent strep infection may cause chorea to recur.
