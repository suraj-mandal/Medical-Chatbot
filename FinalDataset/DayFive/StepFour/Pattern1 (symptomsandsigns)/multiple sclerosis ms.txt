Genetic factors don't seem to play a large role in the disease. Although people who have a first-degree relative with MS have a slightly higher risk of developing it themselves, this risk is felt to be modest.
People who live in northern latitudes (especially Northern European countries) were previously identified as having a higher incidence of the MS. However, over the last 30 years, more cases of MS are now being diagnosed in more temperate regions such as Latin America. Moreover, living in an area until approximately age 15 seems to give someone the relative risk of developing MS for that area. People younger than 15 who move assume the risk of the new location.
Lifestyle factors are not risk factors for developing MS, for example, diet, exercise, tobacco use, unlike conditions in which these risk factors are very important, such as stroke, heart disease, or diabetes.
