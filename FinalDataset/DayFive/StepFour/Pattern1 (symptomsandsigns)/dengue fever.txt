The vector-borne dengue virus infection is contracted from the bite of a striped Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquito that has previously bitten an infected person. The mosquito flourishes during rainy seasons but can breed in water-filled flower pots, plastic bags, and cans year-round. One mosquito bite can cause the disease.
The virus is not contagious and cannot be spread directly from person to person. It is mosquito-borne, so there must be a person-to-mosquito-to-another-person pathway. A mosquito bites a dengue infected person and becomes infected with dengue. That mosquito then bites another person and passes the dengue virus infection to that person. The full life cycle of the virus involves the Aedes mosquito as the vector (transmitter) and the human as the source of infection.
Avoiding mosquitos is important to avoid contracting dengue fever. In dengue-endemic tropical and sub-tropical areas you should wear light-colored long-sleeved shirts and long pants or trousers, use insect repellant, stay or sleep indoors in air conditioning when possible and use mosquito netting over the bed if available.
After being bitten by a mosquito carrying the virus, the incubation period for dengue fever ranges from three to 15 (usually five to eight) days before the signs and symptoms of dengue appear in stages.
