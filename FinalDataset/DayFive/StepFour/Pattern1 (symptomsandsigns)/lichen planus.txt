Most lichen planus is relatively mild. Affected individuals who do not have symptoms do not need treatment. Ultimately, there is no agreed-upon cure for this condition.
If the itch or appearance of the rash are unpleasant, topical corticosteroid creams or topical calcineurin inhibitors like tacrolimus or pimecrolimus may be of help. For localized, itchy, thick lesions, injections of corticosteroids directly into the plaque may helpful. Antihistamines may blunt the itch, particularly if it is only moderate. This effect is in part due to the sedative effect of antihistamines. For oral lesions, topical steroids (cortisone) in special oral preparations are available.
In more severe lichen planus, physicians may recommend oral medications or therapy with ultraviolet light. Oral medications may include a course of oral prednisone or acitretin or griseofulvin. Occasionally, other immunosuppressive agents may be employed. However, the itching may return after the drug has been discontinued. A low-dose oral corticosteroid every other morning may be also prescribed. For painful lesions within the mouth, special mouthwashes containing a painkiller (such as lidocaine) before meals may provide some relief. Any drug or chemical suspected of being the cause of the lichen planus should be discontinued.


Lichen planus usually goes away by itself in time. Some drugs can produce rashes that are similar in appearance to lichen planus. These rashes can be distinguished from lichen planus in that they go away when the offending drug is stopped.
