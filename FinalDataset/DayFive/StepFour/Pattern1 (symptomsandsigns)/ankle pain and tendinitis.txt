Symptoms and signs of ankle pain and ankle tendinitis include pain, stiffness, swelling, discoloration, redness, warmth, tenderness, throbbing, and looseness of the joint.


Ankle pain and ankle tendinitis are diagnosed by a review the history of the pain, when it came on, if trauma or overuse occurred, and whether or not underlying diseases are present. An examination of the ankle joint is performed to determine if there is warmth, redness, swelling, tenderness, and/or looseness of the joint.


The prognosis for ankle pain and ankle tendinitis depends on the specific injury. Most frequently, ankle pain resolves in days to weeks after injury. Sometimes chronic ligament damage at the ankle leads to looseness (laxity) of the joint that causes chronic ankle pain. If underlying disease is the cause of the ankle pain or ankle tendinitis, the outlook depends on its control.


Just as sport activities and accidental trauma are risk factors for ankle pain and ankle tendinitis, they are also preventable situations. Avoiding injury from sports by proper instruction and physical training can minimize the risk of developing ankle pain and ankle tendinitis. Sometimes ankle bracing or ankle taping can prevent ankle pain and ankle tendinitis. Decreasing the risks for accidental injury is also a method of preventing ankle injury.
