Symptoms of bulimia include repeated episodes of bingeing and purging. Binges are defined as uncontrolled episodes of eating food amounts in a short period of time that are clearly more than most people would consume in a similar time period. People with bulimia have trouble controlling their eating during the binges. They also engage in some form of repeated undoing of the excessive food/calories they ingest that occurs during episodes of binge eating. Examples of purging behaviors include making oneself throw up, fasting, excessive exercise, or abuse of laxatives, diet pills, diuretics, or other medications. Bulimic individuals tend to have their self-esteem excessively linked to their appearance in terms of body shape and weight.
Physical signs and symptoms that can be associated with bulimia include sore throat, discolored, deteriorating teeth, and abdominal pain/cramping and bloating associated with repeated vomiting. Individuals with bulimia may develop swollen salivary glands that give the sufferer bigger cheeks. They may also develop constipation, dehydration, dry skin, and thinning hair.
