Bad breath, or halitosis, is most frequently associated with gum disease. The oral bacteria that is present in the mouth release chemical gases called volatile sulfur compounds that have a strong odor. Bad breath can also come from the bacterial plaque that builds up on the tongue. When the plaque and tartar are removed from the teeth and tongue with regular brushing, flossing, and professional dental cleanings, the halitosis can be eliminated. This is the easiest way to reverse bad breath, but it can take a while for the mouth odor to completely disappear. A person needs to be consistent and persistent with oral hygiene to reverse the condition.
Other causes of bad breath include partially erupted wisdom teeth, dry mouth, mouth breathing, postnasal drip, infections in the throat or lungs, tonsil stones, smoking, digestive problems, and systemic diseases like diabetes.
