Most people do not notice any symptoms with pityriasis rosea except for the appearance of the rash itself. Mild, intermittent itching is reported in about 50% of individuals affected, especially when people exercise or take hot showers. Itching seems to increase with stress. Rarely, it is accompanied by flu-like symptoms, such as sore throat, fatigue, nausea, aching, and decreased appetite. Most people are otherwise in very good health and don't exhibit any other symptoms.
