As mentioned above, any condition or activity that results in increased friction over the fingers or toes can lead to the development of corns or calluses. People of all ages can be affected but they are particularly common in people over 65 years of age. Corns and calluses have been shown to affect 20%-65% of people in this age range. Some of these risk factors are
abnormalities in anatomy of the feet or toes;
abnormalities in gait;
bunions;
poorly fitting shoes;
using equipment, tools, or instruments that exert pressure on specific locations on the fingers; and
certain occupations, such as farmers or garden workers.
