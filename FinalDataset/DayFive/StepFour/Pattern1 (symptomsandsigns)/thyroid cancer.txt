Most solitary thyroid nodules (lumps) are benign, but the risk of cancer increases if they occur in people younger than 30 or older than 60.
Women are three times more likely to develop thyroid cancer than men and at a slightly younger age (40 to 50 years old for women versus 60 to 70 for men).
A solitary nodule found in a male is more likely to be cancerous than a solitary nodule found in a female.
A rapidly growing nodule is more likely to be cancerous and is an ominous sign.
X-rays and CT scans of the neck use low doses of radiation but medical testing has not been found to cause thyroid cancer. Nevertheless, in general, it is important to limit the amount of exposures to the least amount of radiation that will provide a clear enough image to help make a diagnosis.
Diets low in iodine may increase the risk of thyroid cancer, but in developed countries, there is usually enough iodine used as food additives that this is not a problem. Lower levels of iodine in the diet may enhance the risk of radiation induced thyroid cancer.
There may be a relationship between poorly controlled diabetes and an increased risk of thyroid cancer.
Children who have had radiation exposure to the neck are at higher risk for thyroid cancer. Studies have looked at children who were given radiation treatments 50-60 years ago when the risks of radiation where less well understood, and their rate of thyroid cancer is increased. Children and women survivors of nuclear reactor accidents (Chernobyl in 1986 has been studied) have an increased risk of thyroid and other types of cancer.
Agent orange exposure may increase the risk of developing thyroid cancer.
There may be a genetic predisposition to thyroid cancer, especially in certain rare types of thyroid cancer.
While smoking is associated with thyroid disease, worsening hypothyroidism and being a risk factor for Graves' disease, smoking does not appear to increase the risk of thyroid cancer.
