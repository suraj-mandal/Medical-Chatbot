There is significant variation in outlook amongst children diagnosed with Reye syndrome. It is dependent upon the severity and progression of the disease. Some children may have mild disease and completely recover, and others may develop permanent dysfunction of the brain or die from the disease. In general, children diagnosed and treated early in the course of the illness have better outcomes. Studies also suggest that those presenting with high ammonia levels have a worse prognosis.


Although we do not know how to prevent Reye syndrome, we do know that reducing aspirin use in children has resulted in a decrease in the incidence of the illness. In 1980, there were over 500 cases of Reye syndrome in the United States, and now there are only one to two cases per year. 
The United Kingdom has seen similar statistics, as well. Health officials 
attribute this remarkable reduction to the cessation of aspirin use in patients less than 18 years of age. It is important to note that several over-the-counter products contain aspirin or aspirin-like compounds. Pepto-Bismol is such an example. There is a separate product without aspirin-like compounds available.


Most research focuses on understanding what the triggers are for Reye syndrome and how aspirin is involved in the disease. In addition, some are trying to determine why some patients progress rapidly and some cases simply resolve.
