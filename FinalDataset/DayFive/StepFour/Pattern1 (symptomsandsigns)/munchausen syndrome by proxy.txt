Although there is no specific cause for factitious disorders, like most other mental disorders, it is understood to be the result of a combination of biological vulnerabilities, ways of thinking, and social stressors (biopsychosocial model). Little is known about the specific biological vulnerabilities of individuals with factitious disorders. Psychologically, factitious disorders perpetrators tend to have trouble forming a healthy bond (attachment) with their children. Personality traits of individuals who have a history of inducing symptoms in the children they care for include trouble managing anger or frustration. Socially, those who feign or induce symptoms in others tend to have suffered from some sort of major negative event (trauma) during their own upbringing, including the death of a parent or other caretaker or having been themselves the victim of child abuse or neglect.
