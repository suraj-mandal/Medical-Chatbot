A bone spur (osteophyte) is a tiny pointed outgrowth of bone.
Bone spurs are usually caused by local inflammation, such as from degenerative arthritisÂ (osteoarthritis) or tendonitis.
Bone spurs develop in areas of inflammation or injury of nearby cartilage or tendons.
Bone spurs may or may not cause symptoms. When they do cause symptoms, the symptoms depend on their location.
Bone spurs can be associated with pain, numbness, tenderness, and weakness if they are irritating adjacent tissues.
Bone spurs are detected by radiologic testing, such as with plain X-rays, ultrasound imaging, MRI scan, CT scan, and myelograms.
Bone spurs are treated only if they are causing symptoms. Initial treatment is directed toward decreasing inflammation and avoiding reinjury when possible.
