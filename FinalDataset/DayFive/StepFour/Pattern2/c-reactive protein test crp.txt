C-reactive protein (CRP) is a blood test marker for inflammation in the body. CRP is produced in the liver and its level is measured by testing the blood.
CRP is classified as an acute phase reactant, which means that its levels will rise in response to inflammation. Other common acute phase reactants include the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and blood platelet count.


There are no signs or symptoms that are specific for an elevated C-reactive protein level, because it is not a specific test. Signs or symptoms, if present, would depend on the underlying inflammatory condition that is the cause of the elevated CRP level.


C-reactive protein is a marker of inflammation and is typically not detected in the blood unless some degree of inflammation is present in the body.
