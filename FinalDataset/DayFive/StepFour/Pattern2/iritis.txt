Iritis is an inflammation of the iris, which is the colored portion of the eye surrounding the pupil. Iritis appears with varying degrees of redness of the affected eye, often with significant pain, sensitivity to light, tearing, and blurred vision. It is usually unilateral, but with some underlying systemic disease processes, it may affect both eyes.


The iris is one of three parts of a tissue in the eye called the uvea (the other two parts are the ciliary body located behind the iris, and the choroid at the back of the eye). Uveitis refers to any swelling along the uveal tract. Anterior uveitis and iridocyclitis are other names for iritis.
