Having a sore throat can be a symptom of many conditions, and many people wonder if their own sore throat might be a sign of something more serious than 
the common cold. Specifically, infectious mononucleosis ("mono") and infection 
with Streptococcus bacteria ("strep throat") are two conditions that both 
produce an extremely painful sore throat. 


Infectious mononucleosis, "mono," "kissing disease," and glandular fever are all terms popularly used for the very common infection typically caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), but other viruses can also cause the disease. This article focuses specifically on the Epstein-Barr virus as a cause of mono since this is the characteristic virus associated with the condition.
The symptoms of Epstein-Barr virus infection include fever, fatigue, malaise, and sore throat. The designation "mononucleosis" refers to an increase in a particular type of mononuclear white blood cells (lymphocytes) in the bloodstream relative to the other white blood cells as a result of the viral infection. Scientifically, EBV is classified as a member of the herpesvirus family.
The disease was first described in 1889 and was referred to as "Dr√ºsenfieber," or glandular fever. The term infectious mononucleosis was first used in 1920 when an increased number of lymphocytes were found in the blood of a group of college students who had fever and symptoms of the condition.
