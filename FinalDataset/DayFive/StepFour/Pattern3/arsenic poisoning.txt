Arsenic is a grey-appearing chemical element (atomic number 33, symbol As in 
the periodic table) also termed a metalloid. Arsenic can exist in a metallic 
state in three forms (yellow, black, and gray; with gray predominating) and in 
ionic forms. Arsenic is considered to be a heavy metal, and arsenic toxicity 
shares some features with poisonings by other heavy metals. Historically, 
arsenic has been used as a medicinal agent, a pigment, a pesticide, and an agent 
with intent to harm (use with criminal intent). Up until 2003, arsenic (in the 
form of chromated copper arsenate) was used in the US as a treatment to prevent 
insect infestation of wood used in building. In 2003 the use of this compound 
was banned by the US Environmental Protection Agency. 
Arsenic is mixed with 
copper or lead to strengthen alloys containing these materials. Arsenic and some 
of its compounds react with proteins, mainly the thiol portions, and uncouples 
the process of oxidative phosphorylation, thus inactivating most cellular 
functions. Consequently, arsenic and some of the substances it combines with are 
deadly poisons to most biologic systems, except for a few bacterial species. 
Arsenic is used in making insecticides and weed killers. Arsenic is also thought 
to be carcinogenic, meaning that it has the potential to 
cause cancer. 
Arsenic 
can be found as a contaminant in food and water sources. Shellfish and other 
seafood, as well as fruits, vegetables, and rice; are the foods most commonly 
contaminated. Arsenic poisoning typically occurs as a result of industrial 
exposure, from contaminated wine or illegally distilled spirits, or in cases of 
malicious intent.
