Endocarditis, an inflammation of the valves of the heart, causes symptoms that can be nonspecific and similar to those of many other conditions. For example, fever, malaise, weakness, and shortness of breath are common symptoms of endocarditis. Other symptoms that can occur with endocarditis are
Depending upon the cause of the endocarditis, other symptoms can occur. These include


Patients with endocarditis can develop:
In endocarditis, blood cultures can often detect the bacteria causing 
the endocarditis. Patients can also develop anemia, blood in urine, 
elevated white blood cell count, and a new heart murmur. 




People with existing diseases of the heart valves (aortic stenosis, 
mitral stenosis, 
mitral regurgitation, etc.) and people who have undergone heart valve replacements are at an increased risk of developing endocarditis. These people are usually given antibiotics prior to any procedure which may introduce bacteria into the bloodstream.  This 
includes routine dental work, minor surgery, and procedures that may 
traumatize body tissues such as colonoscopy and gynecologic or 
urologic examinations. Examples of antibiotics used include oral 
 amoxicillin (Amoxil) and erythromycin (Emycin, Eryc,PCE), as well as 
intramuscular or intravenous ampicillin, gentamicin, and 
vancomycin.
