Melanosis coli usually results from chronic use 
of laxatives of the anthranoid group. Some examples of anthranoid laxatives are 
senna 
(sennosides; Senocot, Senokot EXTRA and others) and rhubarb derivatives. Many of these laxatives have been in use for 
hundreds of years. In 1997, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned 
the use of the popular anthranoid laxative
phenolphthalein due to fears that it 
might be carcinogenic (cancer-causing). Animal studies had shown that extremely 
high doses of phenolphthalein led to tumors in animals, but it has never been 
shown to cause cancers in humans. 
The anthranoid laxatives pass through the gastrointestinal tract unabsorbed 
until they reach the large intestine, where they are changed into their active 
forms. The resulting active compounds cause damage to the cells in the lining of 
the intestine and leads to apoptosis (a form of 
cell death). The damaged (apoptotic) cells appear as darkly pigmented bodies that may be taken up by 
scavenger cells known as macrophages. When enough cells have been damaged, the 
characteristic pigmentation of the bowel wall develops. The condition can 
develop after just a few months of laxative use.
