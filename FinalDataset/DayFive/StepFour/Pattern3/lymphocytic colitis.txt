Individuals with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) do not have 
colitis, even though this condition is sometimes referred to as having "spastic colitis." 
These individuals may have symptoms that mimic colitis such as diarrhea, abdominal 
pain, and mucus in stool. Nevertheless, there is no inflammation of the colon 
in patients with IBS. The cause of symptoms in 
IBS is not clearly known; it may be caused by either abnormal motility (abnormal 
contractions) of the intestinal muscles or abnormally sensitive nerves in the 
intestines (visceral hypersensitivity). 


Microscopic colitis refers to inflammation of the colon 
that is only visible when the colon's lining is examined under a microscope. The 
appearance of the inner colon lining in microscopic colitis is normal by visual 
inspection during colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy. The diagnosis of 
microscopic colitis is made when a doctor, while performing colonoscopy or 
flexible sigmoidoscopy, takes biopsies (small samples of tissue) of the normal-appearing lining, and 
then 
examines the biopsies under a microscope. 
There are two types of microscopic colitis: 1) lymphocytic colitis and 
2) collagenous colitis. 
Some experts believe that lymphocytic colitis and 
collagenous colitis represent different stages of the same disease. 
The inflammation and the collagen probably interfere with absorption of water 
from the colon, resulting in the diarrhea. 
In lymphocytic colitis, there is an accumulation of 
lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) within the lining of the colon.
In collagenous colitis, there is an 
additional layer of collagen (scar tissue) just 
below the lining.
