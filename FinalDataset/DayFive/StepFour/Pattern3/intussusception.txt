Intussusception: Infolding (prolapse) of a portion of the intestine within another immediately adjacent portion of intestine, which predominantly affects children. Intussusception decreases the supply of blood to the affected part of the intestine and frequently leads to intestinal obstruction. The pressure created by the two walls of the intestine pressing together causes inflammation and swelling, and it reduces the blood flow. Death of bowel tissue can occur, with significant bleeding, perforation, abdominal infection, and shock occurring very rapidly. 


Intussusception is an emergency and requires immediate attention.


Most cases of intussusception occur in children between 5 months and 1 year 
of age. Boys develop the condition two times more often than girls. 
Intussusception can also occur in adults and older children, although it is 
uncommon.


The causes of intussusception are not fully known. Most cases in young 
children are idiopathic, (meaning the cause is unknown), although some 
viral and 
 bacterial infections of the intestine may possibly contribute to intussusception 
in infancy. 
Intussusception is very rare in older children and adults. In this 
population, the causes are believed to be due to 
polyps or tumors, which are 
often referred to as the "lead point" of the intussusception.


Early diagnosis and treatment of intussusception is 
essential in order to prevent injury to the intestine and the associated sequelae, including 
surgical removal of the bowel, sepsis, and even death.
