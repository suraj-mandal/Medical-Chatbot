 The muscle damage causes inflammation leading to tenderness, swelling, and weakness of the affected muscles. The dark urine color is due to myoglobin being excreted in the urine by the kidney as it tries to rid the body of the muscle breakdown products.
Symptoms related to the expected complications of rhabdomyolysis include:


Rhabdomyolysis has many causes. Some of the common ones include:
symptoms of kidney failure, which may include swelling of the hands and feet;
shortness of breath as excess fluid builds up in the lungs,
lethargy;
weakness;
symptoms of hyperkalemia (elevations in potassium in the blood) such as weakness, nausea, lightheadedness, and palpitations due to heart rhythm disturbances); and
disseminated intravascular coagulation, a disruption of the normal blood clotting process, may occur as unexplained bleeding.
Muscle trauma or crush injury
Severe burns
Physical torture or child abuse
Prolonged lying down on the ground (people who fall or are unconscious and are unable to get up for several hours)
Prolonged coma
Severe muscle contractions from prolonged seizures
Cocaine use with related hyperthermia (increased body temperature)
Extreme physical activity (running a marathon, extreme workouts)
Drug and alcohol intoxication
Low circulating phosphate, potassium, or magnesium levels in the blood (electrolytes)
Genetic muscle diseases (familial paroxysmal rhabdomyolysis)
Prolonged drowning or hypothermia (low core body temperature)
Medications: most notably statins used to treat high cholesterol (simvastatin [Zocor], atorvastatin [Lipitor], pravastatin [Pravachol], or lovastatin [Mevacor]) and other medications such as Parkinson's medication, psychiatric medications, anesthesia medications, HIV medications, colchicine
Variety of viruses and some bacteria
Severe hypothyroidism (low thyroid level), especially if the person is also taking statin drugs for cholesterol
Lack of blood perfusion to a limb
Some inflammatory disorders of the muscle, called myopathies, (myositis, dermatomyositis, polymyositis)
Venom from certain snake bites (mainly in Africa, Asia, and South America)
