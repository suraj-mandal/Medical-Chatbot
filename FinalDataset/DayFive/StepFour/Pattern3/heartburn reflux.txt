Both a heart attack and heartburn can cause the same symptoms like chest pain, nausea, vomiting, and belching while warning signs and symptoms of a heart attack, for example, dizziness, shortness of breath, headache, and toothache.


Heartburn is a sensation of burning in the chest caused by stomach acid backing up into the esophagus (food pipe). The burning is usually in the central part of the chest, just behind the sternum (breast bone). The burning can worsen or can be brought on by lying flat or on the right side. Pregnancy tends to aggravate heartburn.
Many people experience heartburn and there are a large number of over-the-counter (OTC) medications and home remedies available to treat heartburn.
In most cases you will not need to see a health-care professional, except if the symptoms are frequent (several times a week), severe or increasing in severity.
If heartburn is severe or the pain is accompanied with additional symptoms such as shortness of breath, radiation into your arms or neck, you will need to see a doctor to distinguish these symptoms from more serious medical conditions such as a heart attack.
GERD (Gastroesophageal reflux disease) can be considered a chronic and more serious form of reflux with heartburn as the major symptom; however, there may be other symptoms or no symptoms at all.
If your heartburn symptoms occur more than twice a week you should see your health-care professional to make sure no serious problems are present.
