Peripheral artery disease (or peripheral vascular disease) symptoms include:


In the most severe case, as mentioned above, due to a combination of decreased sensation and reduced blood flow to the feet, ulcers may develop. If the tissues continue to receive insufficient oxygen, tissue death (gangrene) occurs. Gangrene is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition. Other potentially serious problems that may develop include cellulitis (infection of the tissues beneath the skin) and osteomyelitis (infection of the bone); sepsis (the infection spreads to the bloodstream) also is possible.
People with diabetes are at increased risk for milder problems with the feet that are not specific to diabetes but may occur more frequently due to problems with the nerves and circulation to the feet.
Some of these conditions are: (This list is not exhaustive.)
Intermittent claudication
Pain at rest
Numbness in the extremities
Weakness of the calf muscle
Hair loss
Coldness in the legs or feet

Calluses and corns, that may develop due to abnormal alignment of the feet or abnormal gait
Fungal infections of the nails, which can appear as thickened, discolored, and at times brittle nails
Tinea pedis, or athlete's foot, a fungal infection of the skin of the feet
Hammertoes, or bent toes due to muscle weakness.
Bunions, or the angling of the big toe toward the second toe. The area of the bunion may become reddened and irritated, leading to callus formation.
Ingrown toenails
Cracking of the skin of the feet, especially the heels, due to dry skin
