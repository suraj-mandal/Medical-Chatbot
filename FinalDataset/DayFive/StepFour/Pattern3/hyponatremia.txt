We've all learned that fluid replacement is critical when exercising, but drinking too much water during strenuous exercise can cause chemical imbalances and electrolyte deficiencies like sodium (hyponatremia), potassium (hypokalemia), chloride, and calcium (hypocalcemia), if they are not replaced with sports drinks containing these electrolytes.


When sodium levels in the body are low, water tends to enter cells, causing them to swell. When this occurs in the brain, it is referred to as cerebral edema. Cerebral edema is particularly dangerous because the brain is confined in the skull without room for expansion, and the swelling can lead to brain damage as the pressure increases within the skull. Cerebral edema occurs only in severe cases of hyponatremia.
In chronic hyponatremia, in which the blood sodium levels drop gradually over time, symptoms are typically less severe than with acute hyponatremia (a sudden drop in blood sodium level). Symptoms can be very nonspecific and can include:
Other possible symptoms include:
Nausea and vomiting may accompany any of the symptoms.
