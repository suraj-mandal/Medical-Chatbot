A disorder in which the chambers of the heart are dilated (enlarged) because the heart muscle is weakened and cannot pump effectively. There are many causes, the most common being myocardial ischemia (not enough oxygen supplied to the heart muscle) due to coronary artery disease.


DCM can be inherited, but it is primarily caused by a variety of other factors, including:
It can also occur in women after childbirth (postpartum cardiomyopathy).


DCM is diagnosed based on medical history (your symptoms and family history), physical exam, blood tests, electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG), chest X-ray, echocardiogram, exercise stress test, cardiac catheterization, CT scan, and MRI.
Another test rarely done to determine the cause of a cardiomyopathy is a myocardial biopsy, or heart biopsy, where a tissue sample is taken from the heart and examined under a microsope to determine the cause of the symptoms.
If you have a relative with dilated cardiomyopathy, ask your doctor if you should be screened for the condition. Genetic testing may also be available to identify abnormal genes.
