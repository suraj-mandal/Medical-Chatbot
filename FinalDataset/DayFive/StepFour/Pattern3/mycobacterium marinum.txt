People often describe localized swollen areas on, or under, the skin as lumps or bumps. While bumps on, or under, the skin may result from conditions that give rise to a skin rash, many other conditions can result in solitary raised lumps on the skin. Infections, tumors, and the body's response to trauma or injury can all lead to lumps or bumps that appear to be located on or underneath the skin.


Human infections with M. marinum under normal circumstances are rare. People are prone to this infection when there is minor trauma to an extremity like the forearm before or during contact with marine animals like fish or turtles, or just an aquarium, saltwater or freshwater.
However, people who have minor breaks in the skin such as small cuts or scrapes are at increased risk
One form of the infection, known as "swimming pool granuloma," can occur when there is inadequate chlorination of swimming pools. However, in the U.S., most human infections with this bacteria have been associated with contact with fish tanks.


M. marinum infection is not contagious; it is not spread from person to person. It is also not transmitted in hospitals like other common bacteria.


People at highest risk include home-aquarium hobbyists, swimmers, aquarium workers, marine-life handlers, anglers, and oyster workers. Overall, anyone with frequent or persistent saltwater or freshwater exposure is at potential risk. Here is a list of at risk people:
when in contact with water from an aquarium or fish tank,
when handling, cleaning, or processing fish,
while swimming or working in fresh or salt water, or
while standing in contaminated water.
personal home-aquarium owners
professionals who clean aquariums
marine biologists
fishermen and workers exposed to saltwater fish
immunocompromised patients (HIV/AIDS)
