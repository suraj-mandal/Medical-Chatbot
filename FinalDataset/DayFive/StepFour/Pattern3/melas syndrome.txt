MELAS is the acronym for Mitochondrial Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes.
MELAS is a form of dementia. It is caused by mutations in the genetic material (DNA) in the mitochondria. While most of our DNA is in the chromosomes in the cell nucleus, another important cell structure that carries DNA is the mitochondrion. Much of the DNA within the mitochondrion is used to manufacture proteins that help in the mitochondrion's energy-producing function.
As a result of the disturbed function of their cells' mitochondria, patients with MELAS develop brain dysfunction (encephalopathy) with seizures and headaches, as well as muscle disease with a buildup of lactic acid in the blood (lactic acidosis), temporary local paralysis (strokelike episodes), and abnormal thinking (dementia).


There is no known treatment for the underlying disease, which is progressive and fatal. Patients are managed according to what areas of the body are affected at a particular time. antioxidants and vitamins have been used, but there have been no consistent successes reported.


Yes, mutations (genetic changes) in the mitochondrial chromosome are responsible for a number of other disorders aside from MELAS such as:
MELAS and all other mitochondrial diseases were not well understood before it was discovered that they were due to mutations in the chromosomes of the mitochondria.
