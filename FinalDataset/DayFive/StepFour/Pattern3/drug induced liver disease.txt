Severe, advanced liver disease with cirrhosis can produce symptoms and signs related to cirrhosis; these symptoms include:
fatigue, 
weakness, 
vague abdominal pain, and
loss of appetite. 
yellowing of the skin (jaundice) due to the accumulation of bilirubin in the blood,
itching associated with liver disease, and 
easy bruising due to decreased production of blood clotting factors by the diseased liver. 
fluid accumulation in the legs (edema) and abdomen (ascites, due to 
increased pressure in the vessels going into the liver), 

mental confusion or coma (from hepatic encephalopathy due to increase in 
ammonia), 

kidney failure, 

vulnerability to bacterial infections, and 

gastrointestinal bleeding, secondary to varices (enlarged blood vessels in 
the esophagus or stomach).
