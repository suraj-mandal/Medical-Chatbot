Production of blood clotting factors
Production of amino acids (the building blocks for making proteins), including those used to help fight infection
The processing and storage of iron necessary for red blood cell production
The manufacture of cholesterol and other chemicals required for fat transport
The conversion of waste products of body metabolism into urea that is excreted in the urine
Metabolizing medications into their active ingredient in the body
