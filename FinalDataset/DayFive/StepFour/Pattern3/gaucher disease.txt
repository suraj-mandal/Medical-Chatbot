There are a number of types of genetic inheritance and associated disorders. For example, single gene or monogenetic inheritance disorders include:
Another type of genetic inheritance is multifactorial inheritance disorders, 
for example:


Gaucher disease (sometimes called Gaucher's disease) is an inherited 
condition that results in the abnormal accumulation of fatty substances known as 
glycolipids in different body tissues due to a deficiency of an enzyme known as glucocerebrosidase. There are several different types of the condition, 
and the signs and symptoms that arise due to the sphingolipid accumulation vary 
widely. Gaucher disease is due to a genetic defect in a gene known as GBA1. 
Gaucher disease belongs to a class of diseases called lysosomal storage 
diseases, named after a type of cell that is affected by the buildup of 
glycolipids.


The main signs and symptoms of Gaucher disease are:
People with type 1 Gaucher disease usually first notice painless enlargement 
of the spleen, anemia, or bleeding and bruising due to low platelet count. The 
enlargement of the spleen may become severe and may limit a child's growth due 
to the energy required to sustain the enlarging spleen. An enlarged liver and 
abnormal liver function tests are also characteristic signs. Skeletal 
involvement by Gaucher disease is common and can take the form of bone pain, 
fractures of bone, and a defect of the thigh bone (femur).

Anemia (low red blood cell count) 
Fatigue(tiredness) 
Low platelet count, 
that can lead to easy bruising
Â Enlarged spleen and liver (hepatosplenomegaly) 

Easy bleeding that is difficult to stop 
Bone pain, bone crisis (severe bone pain 
often accompanied by fever), and the chance of easily broken bones
