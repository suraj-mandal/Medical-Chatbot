Many people with heart rhythm disorders have no symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they depend upon the cause of the heart rhythm disorder and may include:


Abnormal heart rhythms, either too slow or too fast, decrease the delivery of blood by the heart.  Bradycardia is a condition in which the heart rate is too slow. Bradycardias 
can be due to diseases of the SA node or the conduction tissues of the heart. 
The slow-beating heart delivers an insufficient amount of blood to the body. 
Tachycardia is a condition in which the heart rate is too rapid. When the heart pumps too fast, the ventricles do not have enough time to fill their chambers with blood before the next contraction. Therefore, tachycardias can decrease the amount of blood delivered to he body. One of the effects of decreased blood delivery to the body is low blood pressure.


Abnormally fast heart rates are called tachycardias. Tachycardias are caused by rapidly firing electrical signals arising from the walls of the atria or the ventricles. These rapidly firing signals override the signals generated by the SA node and cause the heart to beat too fast.
Tachycardias caused by electrical signals from the atria are called atrial tachycardias. Tachycardias caused by electrical signals from the ventricles are called ventricular tachycardias.


Symptoms of tachycardias include:
Palpitations
Cheat pain
Weakness
Nausea
Vomiting

Palpitations or fluttering sensations in the heart;
Lightheadedness (due to low blood pressure);
Fainting spells or loss of consciousness (due to low blood pressure);
Fatigue and weakness (due to lack of blood supply); and
A flushing sensation.
