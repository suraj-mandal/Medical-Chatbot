The exact mechanism of how RSD develops is poorly understood. The theories include irritation and abnormal excitation of nervous tissue, leading to abnormal impulses along nerves that affect blood vessels and skin. The involuntary nervous system, peripheral nerves, and brain seem to be involved.
A variety of events can trigger the RSD, including:
injury,
surgery,
heart disease,
degenerative arthritis of the neck,
stroke or other brain diseases,
nerve irritation by entrapment (such as carpal tunnel syndrome),
shingles,
shoulder problems,
breast cancer, and
drugs for tuberculosis and barbiturates.
