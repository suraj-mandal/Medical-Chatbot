Possible warning signs of factitious disorders include:



The exact cause of factitious disorders is not known, but researchers are 
looking at the roles of biological and psychological factors in the development 
of these disorders. Some theories suggest that a history of abuse or neglect as 
a child, or a history of frequent illnesses that required hospitalization might 
be factors in the development of the disorder. 


There are no reliable statistics regarding the number of people in 
		the U.S. who suffer from factitious disorders. Obtaining accurate 
		statistics is difficult because dishonesty is common with this 
		condition. In addition, people with factitious disorders tend to seek 
		treatment at many different health care facilities, which can lead to 
		statistics that are misleading. 
In general, factitious disorders are more common in men than in 
		women. However, factitious disorder by proxy tends to be more common in 
		women than in men. 
Dramatic but inconsistent medical history
Unclear symptoms that are not controllable and that become more

Willingness or eagerness to have medical tests, operations, or other

		offices, possibly even in different cities 
Reluctance by the patient to allow health care professionals to meet
