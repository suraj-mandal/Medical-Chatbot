A Viewer Asks: I have gained a serious amount of weight since the loss of my periods and my doctor believes I have 
	polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Do women who are treated for this condition lose the weight they gained due to PCOS?
Dr. St√∂ppler's Answer: It is still being debated whether the 
weight gain is what caused the
polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) to emerge, or whether PCOS causes weight gain. It is known that obesity, sometimes even beginning early in life, is present in about half of women with PCOS.


PCOS's principal signs and symptoms are related to menstrual disturbances and elevated levels of male hormones (androgens). Menstrual disturbances can include delay of normal menstruation (primary amenorrhea), the presence of fewer than normal menstrual periods (oligomenorrhea), or the absence of menstruation for more than three months (secondary amenorrhea ). Menstrual cycles may not be associated with ovulation (anovulatory cycles) and may result in heavy bleeding.
Symptoms related to elevated androgen levels include acne, excess hair growth on the body (hirsutism), and male-pattern hair loss.
Other PCOS signs and symptoms include:
Any of the above symptoms and signs may be absent in PCOS, with the exception of irregular or no menstrual periods. All women with PCOS will have irregular or no menstrual periods. Women who have PCOS do not ovulate regularly; that is, they do not release an egg every month. This is why they do not have regular periods and typically have difficulty conceiving.
