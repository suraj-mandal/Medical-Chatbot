This condition is very rare, affecting about 1 per 
million newborns. In most parts of the world, tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency 
accounts for only 1 percent to 2 percent of all cases of elevated phenylalanine 
levels. The remaining cases are caused by a similar condition called 
 phenylketonuria (PKU). In certain countries, including Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, China, and Turkey, it is more common for elevated levels of phenylalanine to be caused by tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency.


Tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency can be caused by mutations in one of several genes, including GCH1, PCBD1, PTS, and QDPR. These genes provide instructions for making enzymes that help produce and recycle tetrahydrobiopterin in the body. Tetrahydrobiopterin (also known as BH4) is a molecule that helps process several amino acids, including phenylalanine. It is also involved in the production of 
chemicals called neurotransmitters, which transmit signals between nerve cells 
in the brain.


If one of the enzymes fails to function correctly because 
of a gene mutation, little or no tetrahydrobiopterin is available to help 
process phenylalanine. As a result, phenylalanine can build up in the blood and 
other tissues. Because nerve cells in the brain are particularly sensitive to 
phenylalanine levels, excessive amounts of this substance can cause brain damage. Tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency can also alter the levels of certain neurotransmitters, which disrupts normal brain function.
