Shock is a life-threatening medical condition as a result of 
insufficient blood flow throughout the body. Shock often accompanies severe 
injury or illness. Medical shock is a medical emergency and can lead to other 
conditions such as lack of oxygen in the body's tissues (hypoxia), heart attack 
(cardiac arrest) or organ damage. It requires immediate treatment as symptoms 
can worsen rapidly. 
Medical shock is different than emotional or psychological shock that can 
occur following a traumatic or frightening emotional event. 


Septic shock results from bacteria multiplying in the blood and releasing 
toxins. Common causes of this are pneumonia, 
urinary tract infections, 
skin infections (cellulitis), intra-abdominal infections (such as 
a
ruptured appendix), and 
meningitis. 
Anaphylactic shock is a type of severe hypersensitivity or 
allergic reaction. 
Causes include allergy to 
insect stings, medicines, or 
foods (nuts, berries, 
seafood), etc.
Cardiogenic shock happens when the heart is damaged and unable to supply 
sufficient blood to the body. This can be the end result of a heart attack or 
 congestive heart failure.
Hypovolemic shock is caused by severe blood and fluid loss, such as from 
traumatic bodily injury, which makes the heart unable to pump enough blood to 
the body, or severe anemia 
where there is not enough blood to carry oxygen through the body. 
Neurogenic shock is caused by 
spinal cord injury, usually as a result 
of a traumatic accident or injury.
