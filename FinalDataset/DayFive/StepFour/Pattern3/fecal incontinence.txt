Bowel incontinence refers to the inability to control the passage of small 
amount of stool, liquid or solid, or control flatus.
People are sometimes reluctant to discuss their lack of bowel control 
because of the social stigma attached to it. Their initial complaint might be 
 anal itching (pruritis ani), a buttock skin infection, or breakdown of the skin 
and ulcers.


Taking a history is very important and the health care professional will 
spend time learning about how often loss of bowel control occurs, in what 
situations and whether it is solid, liquid, or gas. Past medical and surgical 
history is important, especially obstetric history or surgery of the anus, 
including hemorrhoids. It could be several years before the complication of a 
surgery or childbirth lead to fecal incontinence. Dietary habits and medications 
(including over-the-counter medications and laxative) will also be considered 
and evaluated.
Physical examination will likely include a rectal examination to assess 
sphincter tone. In females, a pelvic exam will also be performed.
While blood tests are not usually needed to make the diagnosis, other tests 
may be helpful in deciding the potential cause of fecal incontinence. Anal 
manometry measures the pressure within the rectum, both at rest and when the 
patient squeezes the anal sphincter. Nerve and muscle conduction studies may be 
considered. Ultrasound can evaluate the anal sphincters and look for muscle 
damage.
