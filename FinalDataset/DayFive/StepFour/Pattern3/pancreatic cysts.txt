The symptoms of pancreatic cysts depend on their size and location. Small (less than two cm) cysts usually cause no symptoms. Large pancreatic cysts can cause
	abdominal pain and 
	back pain presumably by exerting pressure on the surrounding tissues and nerves. 
	
Small or large cysts in the head of the pancreas also may cause
	jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes with 
	darkening of 
	the urine) due to obstruction of the common bile duct. (Obstruction causes bile to back up and forces bilirubin--the chemical that produces jaundice--back into the bloodstream 
	and forces it to be excreted in the urine.) 
	
If the cysts become infected, it may result in
	fever, 
	chills, and 
	sepsis.  
	
On rare occasions, large pseudocysts can compress the stomach or the duodenum leading to obstruction  
	to the movement of food in the intestines, resulting in abdominal pain and
	vomiting. 
	
If a cyst becomes malignant and begins to invade the surrounding tissues, it may lead to the same type of pain as 
	pancreatic cancer, pain that usually is constant and felt in the back and upper abdomen.
