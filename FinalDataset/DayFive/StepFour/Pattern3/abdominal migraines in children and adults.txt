The cause of abdominal migraine is poorly understood. Abdominal migraine is 
thought by some researchers to be related to neurologic or endocrinologic 
changes and may be caused by alterations in the levels of serotonin and 
histamine in the body. Genetic factors may also be involved as the condition is 
more common in children who have a family history of migraine. About 60% of 
children with the condition have a positive family history for migraine. 
Triggers for abdominal migraine have been described, similar to triggers for 
classic migraine. These include chocolate or nitrite-containing foods, stress, 
and anxiety.


As mentioned, abdominal migraine causes pain in the abdomen that can be 
severe and debilitating. It is typically located in the middle portion of the 
belly, often around the umbilicus. Cramping, nausea, and vomiting can accompany 
the pain. Pallor (paleness) of the skin is often observed. There may not be associated 
headache. The symptoms are usually relieved by sleep and can last anywhere from 
one hour to several days.


Because of the frequent absence of headache, the condition can be difficult 
to diagnose, especially during the first episode. There is no specific test that 
can establish the diagnosis of abdominal migraine, so the diagnosis is based on 
exclusion of other conditions. Laboratory tests and imaging studies are usually 
directed to rule out other conditions that could be responsible for the 
symptoms. Electroencephalography (EEG) is sometimes done to rule out a
seizure 
disorder as the cause of the symptoms.
