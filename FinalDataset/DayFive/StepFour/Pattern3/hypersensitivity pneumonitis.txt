Chronic (long-term) hypersensitivity pneumonitis causes 
 lung scarring (fibrosis).


Symptoms of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis include:
Chronic disease is believed to occur after prolonged low grade exposure to the offending particles.
It is sometimes quite surprising that individuals with a passion for their 
hobbies or occupation will continue to allow exposure to lung damage (if the 
offending particles are related to the hobby or job) despite the knowledge that 
it is harmful.


Examples of hypersensitivity pneumonitis include:
A more detailed analysis is listed in the table, which includes the 
	types of compounds, bacteria, and molds known to cause hypersensitivity 
	pneumonitis.


Shortness of breath 
Cough
Farmer's lung disease from exposure to mold spores in hay
Pigeon breeder's disease from exposure to protein particles in 
	pigeon droppings
	
Sauna takers' disease from exposure to mold growing in wet 
	containers
	
Mushroom workers' disease from exposure to moldy compost
Bagassosis from exposure to moldy sugar cane
Winemaker's lung from exposure to a fungus on grapes called 
	Botrytis cinerea
An unusual case was published involving a case of hypersensitivity to 
	Canadian goose droppings. The individual was a physician who was exposed 
	to both indoor and outdoor antigens while living in a suburban Illinois 
	community. One can only imagine the tremendous detective work necessary to 
	make this diagnosis.
